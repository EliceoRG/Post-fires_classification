# Post-fires CART Classification model

This model will be able to measure burned areas affected by wildfires in km2 by classifying dark reflectance. The classes examples are forest, non-forest, and burned areas. This example is a wildfire in the Arrowhead Region of Minnesota in the United States.	 
  
The model will be able to function in any area of interest to calculate the area affected by the fire while training the points of interest. You will need to download the example loaded as a shapefile to make this model work. Then, the polygons and trained data must be imported with the "Pre-upload data" script.

Script will work for:
  - Lancover classification
  - Accuracy assesment
  - Confusion Matrix 
  - Measure area Km2
